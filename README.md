### Hi there, I'm Kamal G. Oladele 👋

]I am a Master's student in **Systems Engineering** (4.0 GPA) at Missouri S&T, concurrently earning a **Graduate Certificate in Computational Intelligence**. My work is at the intersection of complex systems, data science, and artificial intelligence.

My research focuses on building robust, intelligent frameworks for modeling, simulation, and optimization. I am passionate about applying **Model-Based Systems Engineering (MBSE)**, **Digital Twins**, and **Deep Learning** to solve critical challenges in healthcare, robotics, and cyber-physical systems. I am actively seeking a Ph.D. position for Fall 2026.

### 🔭 My Key Research & Projects

* **Generative AI for Systems Engineering:** Using LLMs (Grok, Gemini, ChatGPT) to interpret natural language requirements and generate traceable SysML artifacts (BDDs, IBDs) in Cameo.
* **Foundation Models for Vision:** Fine-tuning the Segment Anything Model (SAM2) with Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) for high-precision infrastructure crack detection.
* **Predictive Healthcare AI:** Benchmarking multi-modal deep learning models (1D ResNet + TabNet) for multi-label cardiovascular disease classification on the 21,000-sample PTB-XL dataset.
* **Digital Twin & Simulation:** Modeling cyber-physical systems (like a Smart Exercise Bike) using MBSE principles and simulation tools (AnyLogic, Unity) to validate system behavior.
